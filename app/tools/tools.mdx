I use this site to test out & learn new technologies, and have done so with the previous iterations of my site too. 
I've previously used Jekyll, CRA and Gatsby, which you can read more about on the [Site Archive](/archive) page.

Here's the stack I decided on for this iteraton:

## Framework - Next.js

I went with Next.js because I wanted this site to be a mix of static and dynamic pages.

Next.js allows all of these things with ease. 

## Styling - CSS Modules (SCSS) & Styled Components

The majority of this site uses CSS modules, since this site is primarily React Server Components, which don't really 
support CSS-in-JS libraries.

However, some things, e.g. the `<Title />` component you see at the top of this page, use Styled Components. This is because
I want to pass them props (in this case the title), which isn't supported with CSS modules. The trade off is that
these components have to be client components. 

## Hosting - Vercel

Being a Next.js site, this is a pretty standard choice.
