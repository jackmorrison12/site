For this iteration of my site, I wanted to spend more time planning the stack I'd use to build the optimal site.

You can see some previous projects written using Jekyll, CRA and Gatsby on the [Site Archive](/archive) page

Here's the stack I decided on:

## Framework - Next.js

I went with Next.js because...

## Styling - CSS Modules & Styled Components in SASS

Ideally, I'd be styling completely using Styled Components, since they're my preferred method, 
however because I wanted this site to be made up of as many React Server Components as possible, 
this wasn't feasible, since Styled Components have to be client-side rendered.

## Hosting - Vercel

Being a Next.js site, this is a pretty standard choice

## Other useful tools & libraries

- TypeScript
- React Query
- ESLint
- Prettier
