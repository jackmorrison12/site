highlights:
  - Created a collaborative drawing whiteboard application for iOS
  - Researched Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
  - Used a mesh network topology consisting of local Bluetooth connections and a global XMPP server to allow for decentralisation
  - Created a public protocol to interoperate with other whiteboard applications, including one created by other students

We've noticed a trend: over the last few years, everything is becoming more collaborative

But one thing is lagging behind... _drawing tools_

That is, until now

Introducing... <Accent>Canvas</Accent>

<ImgWithCaption imgProps={{src:'/img/canvas-1.png', alt:'CRDTs - Canvas', height:'540', width:'960'}}>

## What is canvas?

We have created a resilient collaborative drawing app for iPadOS, using _Conflict-free Replicated Data Types_, or <Accent>CRDTs</Accent>

</ImgWithCaption>

<ImgWithCaption imgProps={{src:'/img/canvas-2.png', alt:'Features - Canvas', height:'540', width:'960'}}>

## Features

Canvas has everything you'd expect from a drawing app, such as various design tools and sharing options, plus more advanced features, such as extremely accurate\* <Accent>shape and line recognition</Accent>

</ImgWithCaption>

<ImgWithCaption imgProps={{src:'/img/canvas-3.png', alt:'Users - Canvas', height:'540', width:'960'}}>

## Users

Canvas allows up to <Accent>1000 users</Accent>\* to connect and draw at the same time

But what makes it different to every other online whiteboard?

It's <Accent>de-centralised</Accent>

</ImgWithCaption>

<ImgWithCaption imgProps={{src:'/img/canvas-4.png', alt:'Networking - Canvas', height:'540', width:'960'}}>

## Networking

Our app uses a dual connection mechanism, making use of an <span class="highlight">XMPP</span> server, for long-distance drawing, and a <span class="highlight">Bluetooth</span> mesh topology, for optimised close-range drawing

This creates a <Accent>resilient, de-centralised\*\* network</Accent>

</ImgWithCaption>

<Footnote>

\*CRDTs are currently an open research area, so this project started as a proof of concept to see if they could be used in this context. We wrote a [report](/files/canvas-report.pdf) which analyses referenced statistics in much more depth.

\*\*CRDTs are a class of abstract data types that allow their state to be distributed across devices, modified locally and then merged in a straight-forward manner, meaning that they guarantee eventual consistency. Therefore, Canvas is completely de-centralised, and as such does not rely on one of the nodes to always be connected to the XMPP server.
