## Creativity, Curiosity, Coding!

Those are our three C's, our core values here at PyPlay.

We created an application to teach young coders the basics of Python.

We provide an easy-to-use interface, where kids can write code, and visually see their code come to life.

Unlike other platforms, where you drag-and-drop blocks, with PyPlay, you're actually writing real Python code!

We created this for IC Hack 2020.
