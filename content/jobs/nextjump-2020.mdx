Over the summer of 2020, I returned to Nextjump as a Software Engineer. I was given more responsibility to work on larger projects. I got to expand my skills, using new technologies such as Vue.js, and spend more time using Go.

At the start of my placement, I focused on improving the User Experience of Nextjump's platform. This required working with other teams to do research to create engineering solutions to problems we were finding. Towards the end, I was improving existing systems, both internal and external facing, to prepare for increased user traffic and revenue in Q4 of 2020.
